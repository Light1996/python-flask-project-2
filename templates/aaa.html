                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is AAA?</h2>
                        <p>
The AAA pattern is a pattern for structuring tests. It breaks each test down into three parts – Arrange, Act, and Assert – where each part is a step leading to the next. The arrange step sets up the test’s input values. The act step prompts the primary function being tested. And finally, the assert step verifies that the output of the function is what was expected.

In other words, each step in the pattern is a function whose return value is the input of the following step. For example,
                        </p>
                        <p>assert(act(arrange()));</p>
                        <p>
                            Here each step is represented as a function called in order from right to left. Arrange is called first. The result of arrange is passed to the act function, and act’s result is subsequently passed to assert. Assert returns void, a bool, or whatever you as the author determine valuable for the purpose of the test.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Setup and usage?</h2>
                        <p>
                            To set this up, you must first create a separate test method accessible to every test. One solution is to create a ‘TestFixture’ class that is inherited by every test class. This class could look something like this –
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            public class TestFixture{
                                public void Test<, TActResult>(
                                    Func<> arrange,
                                    Func<>, TActResult> act,
                                    Action<> assert)
                                {
                                    assert(act(arrange()));
                                }
                            }
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The test method can then be used in several different test cases. That is, only if the signatures of the functions you create match the signatures of the test method’s parameters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in all, the AAA pattern is only meant to be a guideline. It is a structure, or a way of thinking about and arranging your tests so that they can be clearly understood. There is no package or downloadable tool with documentation. Instead, it defers to you, the author, how best to create and use it.

I have found that creating functions for each step in the pattern offers one of the most versatile solutions. Functions are like building blocks; you can reuse blocks in different designs. Or, in our case, you can reuse different functions in different test cases.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why we do Testing?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Because you want to write good quality software, and it’s been demonstrated that writing tests increase the overall quality of code.

Because having tests in place makes refactoring safer and easier.

Because you want to ensure that your code behaves correctly, and while you can’t prove the absence of bugs, finding them through testing is way better than finding them in production.

Because it’s one of the most cost-effective practices to improve the quality of your code.

                        <p>
                            Tezting important in gauging the worth of something. So,
                            a test provided many things dorbthe benefit of people especially
                            if they are medical supplies introduced just recently.
                            It means it passed a test. It is available for use by peope needing it.
                            School tests or examination were like gauging a student’s ability,
                            his her capacity to reach the standard of the school’s rules and regulations
                            for student’s to follow. Admittance of the students passing the exams will
                            provide one the standard, high or low , and make feelmone a part of the group.
